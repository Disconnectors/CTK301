          <p id="description">This is the game I created for one of my projects in Game Development class. The goal of the assignment was to create a game from examples we've looked at in class using assets from online stores. I've gathered my assets from the Unity asset store and I wrote all the scripts myself.</p>

          <p id="description">This was my final project for my Game Development class. The instructions gave a lot of freedom so I decided to make a puzzle game. This puzzle game is unique as the whole level is pitch black and the player can only see themselves, the enemy, and the goal. The player gets a little guidance in small vision around themselves so they know which paths they can take but other than that, it is trial and error to complete the game. Download now for a quick game time!</p>

          <p id="description">This project is my first ever game I fully finished. Although it is just another remake of all those scrolling shooter games, I am still proud of myself being able to finish a project. I hope to one day revisit this project and add additional enemies and mechanics to the game.</p>
