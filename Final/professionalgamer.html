          <p id="description">Collegiate League of Legends is what pushed me to compete at the highest level and travel all around the nation to play. I attended University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario, Canada from 2016 to 2018 for Computer Science and during my second year there, I was on the Varsity League of Legends team. We went on winning our conference and going to Los Angeles to play the championship. Going to this championship is what changed my whole life and devoting my life into this game. Upon leaving school, I took a year off to practice and take time off from school. In 2019, I got picked up by Grand View University in Des Moines, Iowa. I also changed my degree to game design upon talking to Riot employees. After achieving championship, and championship getting cancelled due to COVID-19, I moved on to Illinois State University in 2021. Here, we went on to get 2nd place in our conference and ending top 8 in championship.</p>

          <p id="description">My history of amateur play is just as long as my Collegiate play. I joined my first team, AZIO White in 2018 while I took a break from school. I wanted to get as much experience as possible. After getting first and second places across every tournament online, we were flown to two tournaments. Then, I joined Fruition Esports in 2019 with bunch of friends. We went on to win the major amateur tournament then disbanded. Then the last amateur team I played on was CLT Pheonix. We were just friends playing for fun but we were able to take a lot of games off of the best teams in the tournaments.</p>
