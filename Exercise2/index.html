        <p>Mirrors on the ceiling,
The pink champagne on ice
And she said "We are all just prisoners here, of our own device"
And in the master's chambers,
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives,
But they just can't kill the beast - Hotel California by Eagles</p>

        <p> This image is about how workers should use goggles to protect their eyes. It is done by WPA Illinois Safety Division. It seems like the workers on the top left are doing phyiscal labor and the large picture of the man wearing glasses seems like he's setting an example.
